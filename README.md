# Arduino-Based-Electronic-Voting-Machine-
Voting is complex process which required high transparency.
We have proposed Arduino micro controller based secure electronic voting system.
This is an advanced and robust system, in which all the data related to voting is stored in the form of digital information in cloud which makes it fully secure from any kind of ringing in the elections.
In total, this voting system overcomes maximum the drawbacks of traditional ballot paper-based voting. 
This system will surely ensure a more secure and safer method of voting for elections.
However, for its use to widely spread it is important to aim for a system that properly is able to fulfil all the requirements expected as well as the standards achievable by the use of technology. 
The system provided by this paper goes the lengths to cover the necessities that met the requirement for a fair, transparent and reliable election tool.
This project assures that, if this system is brought into practice it will reduce the rate of corruption in a honest and sincere way. 
This system is a small contribution for a fair election Designed a microcontroller-based electronic voting system using Arduino, capable of accurately  processing and counting up to 1500 votes per session with secure validation logic.  
Developed a PC-integrated result management interface to digitally store and display voting data, reducing manual counting effort by 90% and ensuring 100% result accuracy. 
Implemented debounced button inputs and session-based logging, enabling reliable operation across multiple voting cycles with consistent performance.
